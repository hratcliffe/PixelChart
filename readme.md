# Photo to Cross Stitch Pattern

## What does this do?

Turns a photo into a potential cross-stitch pattern, and generates a full featured pattern pdf.
You can resize the image to a sensible size, manipulate the number of colours used and match
them to available colour palette. A loose description of the colour is given using a simple algorithm
(which is very bad at characterising brown, its a work in progress), as well as (if selected)
a colour name in specific brands if brand data is available.
Final pattern files contain a colour image, an image with symbols plus key and guide lines and optionally
thread colour codes with very approximate length estimates and a final size estimate in 3
choices of gauge.

For specific brands, a file with names, RGB codes and hex codes is required.
Approximate values for DMC are included. No affiliation implied!


## What is a "potential pattern"?

I'd like to make patterns that are easy to stitch, but this is a work-in-progress. Right now
there may be many isolated stitches and oddly shaped regions in the design. Proceed with
caution and consider using less colours than you think and adding back-stitch detail instead.

## Which features are working?

Loading and saving images and PDF patterns, recolouring with a fixed number of colours and
mapping those colours to pallettes (interactive choice). Gauge selection to give finished
size works. Thread amount estimates are VERY APPROXIMATE and are intended only to indicate
whether multiple skeins might be needed. Patterns can be titled and annotated.

## What's a work-in-progress

More colour manipulation - hue, brightness and contrast adjustments
Better resizing control
Custom optimisations for image type - portraits need more colours in the foreground for example

Longer term I might add
Better patterns - larger colour blocks, reduced aliasing (long term goal)
Backstitching suggestions
